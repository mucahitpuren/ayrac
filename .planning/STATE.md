# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-25)

**Core value:** "Do I already own this book?" gets a fast, reliable answer from any device, at the work level, across editions and formats.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Private Shelf (Walking Skeleton)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Private Shelf (Walking Skeleton))
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan (run `/gsd-sketch` first to pick the visual direction)
Last activity: 2026-09-25 — Sketches 001–003 done (visual direction chosen); requirements now 64/64 mapped

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Vertical MVP slices. Phase 1 is a deployed walking skeleton with i18n, theme, RLS and secrets hygiene wired in from day one.
- [Roadmap]: Search (the core value) comes before import. Import and API add reuse its single Turkish normalization module and duplicate key.
- [Roadmap]: Password reset and Google sign-in move to Phase 7, since both depend on production redirect URLs and email deliverability on the custom domain.
- [Roadmap]: The copy-level note field arrives in Phase 1 (READ-04), so Phase 3 import can map "Kitap Türü" values into it.
- [Roadmap]: Standing gates: two-account RLS isolation test (extended per new table/bucket), Turkish folding tests (from Phase 2), no secrets in repo.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Visual direction not chosen yet. Run `/gsd-sketch` before `/gsd-ui-phase 1` / `/gsd-plan-phase 1`.
- [Phase 2/3]: The real library `data/kitaplar.xlsx` is gitignored personal data. Use it locally for threshold and import tuning, and commit only anonymized fixtures.
- [Phase 3]: The `xlsx` npm package has CVE-2023-30533. Use the patched SheetJS build or an alternative parser.
- [Phase 7]: A custom domain must be available. Supabase free-tier email is rate-limited, so custom SMTP may be needed.
